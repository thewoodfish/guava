# LedgerProof — Demo Script

**Target length:** 3 minutes max.

---

## OPENING (0:00 – 0:20)

*Show: landing page*

"Across Nigeria and emerging economies, millions of small businesses are locked out of formal credit—not because they aren't profitable, but because they can't produce the paperwork lenders require. And for those who can, getting a loan means handing over their entire financial history. LedgerProof changes that. Businesses prove they're creditworthy using zero-knowledge proofs. Lenders get the proof they need. No financial documents ever change hands."

---

## LENDER SETS POLICY (0:20 – 0:50)

*Show: sign up as lender → lender dashboard → My Lending Profile tab*

> "A lender signs up and configures their underwriting criteria — minimum revenue, minimum balance, maximum volatility, customer concentration limits. These thresholds become the public inputs committed into the ZK circuit."

*Click Save & Publish.*

> "They publish. Borrowers can now see this lender and apply."

---

## BORROWER UPLOADS STATEMENT (0:50 – 1:30)

*Show: open new tab → sign up as borrower → borrower dashboard → My Statement tab*

> "A borrower signs up and uploads their bank statement — just an XLSX export from their bank."

*Upload the file.*

> "LedgerProof parses every transaction and classifies it. Then we compute the financial metrics."

*Click Compute Metrics → financial summary appears.*

> "Average monthly revenue, average balance, revenue volatility, customer concentration, debt ratio, account age — all computed privately. These numbers never leave this dashboard."

---

## BORROWER APPLIES (1:30 – 1:45)

*Show: Browse Lenders tab → lender card with criteria chips*

> "The borrower can see all published lenders and the exact criteria they'll be measured against."

*Click Apply.*

> "One click to apply. No documents submitted. The lender receives nothing yet."

---

## LENDER GENERATES PROOF (1:45 – 2:30)

*Switch back to lender tab → Applications tab*

> "On the lender side, an anonymised application comes in. No name, no financials — just an applicant ID and a timestamp."

*Click Generate Proof.*

> "The lender triggers proof generation. Watch the pipeline."

*Let the 5 steps animate — narrate each:*

> "First, nargo compiles a witness from the borrower's financial metrics. Then Barretenberg derives the UltraHonk verification key. The prover constructs a 14-kilobyte cryptographic proof. bb verify confirms it's valid. And finally — the decision is recorded on Stellar."

*LOAN APPROVED banner appears.*

---

## SHOW THE RESULT (2:30 – 2:50)

*Show: predicate list, proof metadata, Stellar section*

> "Every predicate — PASS. The proof hash, verification key hash, proof size, circuit ID. And here — a live Stellar transaction. The loan decision is stored permanently on-chain. Anyone can verify it."

*Click "View on Stellar Expert" → show the transaction in the browser.*

> "That's a real transaction on Stellar testnet. Contract `CDY7T3...`. Immutable record."

---

## CLOSE (2:50 – 3:00)

*Show: landing page tagline*

> "LedgerProof. Prove financial health. Not financial history."

---

## Tips Before Recording

- Use two browser windows or two profiles — one logged in as lender, one as borrower
- Make sure the backend is running and testnet is reachable before you hit record
- The proof generation takes a few seconds — don't cut it, let the animation play
- Zoom in on the Stellar tx hash section — that's the money shot for the judges
