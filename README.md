# Guava

> **Prove financial health. Not financial history.**

Guava is a privacy-preserving SME lending protocol. Businesses prove they meet loan criteria using zero-knowledge proofs — without handing over a single bank statement, customer name, or balance figure.

Stellar is the settlement layer for the entire underwriting process — not a logging endpoint bolted on at the end. When a lender publishes their criteria, those criteria are stored on-chain via `publish_policy()`. When a borrower's ZK proof is verified, the decision is recorded on-chain via `record_decision()`, anchored to the exact criteria the lender committed to. The chain of trust is complete, auditable, and immutable at both ends. No financial documents change hands at any point.

## The Problem

Amara runs a fabric shop in Aba. Every week she sells fabric, pays suppliers, and brings in steady revenue. She has customers, healthy cash flow, and years of trading experience.

Before the festive season she needs a ₦2 million working capital loan to buy inventory.

To apply, her bank asks for:

- 6 months of certified bank statements
- CAC registration documents
- 2 years of audited accounts
- A detailed business plan
- Utility bills and proof of address
- Collateral (land, property, or guarantor)

Amara doesn't have most of these.

She has never hired an auditor. She rents her shop. She has no land to pledge as collateral. Her business is healthy, but it isn't documented in the way the financial system expects.

So she's rejected—not because she can't repay the loan, but because she can't produce the paperwork.

This is the reality for **40 million MSMEs in Nigeria**. Millions of small businesses generate real economic activity every day, yet remain invisible to formal credit because traditional underwriting depends on documents instead of demonstrated financial behaviour.

---

### The Numbers

Nigeria's small businesses are the backbone of the economy — yet the financial system treats them as an afterthought.

| Stat | Figure | Source |
|---|---|---|
| MSMEs in Nigeria | ~40 million | NBS/SMEDAN Survey, 2021 |
| MSME contribution to GDP | ~48% | ILO, 2022 |
| MSME share of employment | ~84–88% | ILO / NBS |
| Share with access to formal bank credit | **4%** | Punch / Leadership, 2024 |
| MSME financing gap in Nigeria | **$236 billion** | Leadership NG, 2024 |
| #1 barrier cited by SMEs | High interest rates (27%) | PwC MSME Survey, 2024 |
| #2 barrier cited by SMEs | Long procedures (26%) | PwC MSME Survey, 2024 |
| Typical SME loan interest rate | 30%+ per annum | Punch NG, 2024 |

96% of Nigeria's businesses are MSMEs. Only 4 in every 100 can access a formal loan. The other 96 are locked out — not because they aren't creditworthy, but because proving creditworthiness is too expensive, too slow, and too invasive.

---

### Why the Process is Broken

Lenders need evidence that a business can repay a loan.

Today, the only tools they have are documents: audited accounts, bank statements, collateral, guarantors, and business plans. For many small businesses, these documents simply don't exist.

What does exist is something far more valuable:

- Consistent sales
- Healthy cash flow
- Reliable supplier payments
- Months or years of trading history

These are often the strongest indicators of whether a business can repay a loan.

The problem isn't that these businesses lack financial health.

**The problem is that they lack an accepted way to prove it.**

The current system forces borrowers to compensate by repeatedly handing over their entire financial history to every lender they approach. The SME bears the cost—in time, in paperwork, and in privacy—with no guarantee of approval.

**Guava replaces document-based lending with proof-based lending.**

Instead of asking:

> Show me your bank statements.

A lender asks:

- Is monthly revenue above ₦X?
- Has cash flow been positive for N consecutive months?
- Is average balance above ₦Y?
- Are there missed loan repayments?

The borrower proves those statements cryptographically—without revealing bank balances, customer names, transaction histories, or any other financial details.

Credit should be based on **provable financial behaviour**, not paperwork.

No statements. No transactions. No balances. The lender learns only whether a mathematical predicate over private data is true.

## How It Works — In Practice

### Borrower — Upload Statement & Compute Metrics

The borrower uploads their XLSX bank statement. Guava extracts every transaction, classifies it, and computes the financial summary on Guava's servers. The raw figures are never shared with any lender.

![Borrower statement upload and financial summary](frontend/assets/Screenshot%202026-06-30%20at%2001.53.27.png)

---

### Borrower — Browse Lenders

Published lending desks are listed with their ZK criteria visible — minimum revenue, minimum balance, maximum volatility, maximum customer concentration. The borrower sees what they are being measured against before they apply.

![Browse published lenders](frontend/assets/Screenshot%202026-06-30%20at%2001.53.39.png)

---

### Borrower — My Applications

Applications are tracked per lender with live status (Pending → Approved / Rejected). The borrower's financial data stays private throughout — the lender never sees the underlying statements, transactions, or balances at any point in the process.

![Borrower application tracker](frontend/assets/Screenshot%202026-06-30%20at%2001.53.47.png)

---

### Lender — Configure & Publish ZK Lending Policy On-Chain

The lender sets their underwriting criteria — minimum revenue, minimum balance, maximum volatility — and clicks **Save & Publish**. The backend immediately calls `publish_policy()` on the deployed Soroban contract, writing the 8-field policy to Stellar persistent storage. A "Lending Criteria Published on Stellar" card appears with the policy transaction hash and a link to Stellar Expert.

This happens **before any borrower applies**. The lender's criteria are public, immutable, and verifiably on-chain from the moment they publish — not assembled retroactively after a decision is made.

![Lender policy configuration](frontend/assets/Screenshot%202026-06-30%20at%2001.53.58.png)

---

### Lender — Incoming Applications

Borrowers appear as anonymised applicants (`Applicant #0d72c5ed`). The lender sees the application date and status — no names, no financial figures. A pending application has a **Generate Proof** button; the lender triggers the ZK verification from here.

![Lender incoming applications queue](frontend/assets/Screenshot%202026-06-30%20at%2002.31.29.png)

---

### Lender — Generate Proof & Loan Decision

The lender clicks **Generate Proof**. The UI steps through the full proving pipeline in real time — witness compilation, VK generation, UltraHonk proving, and cryptographic verification. The result shows each predicate individually (PASS / FAIL), the proof hash, verification key hash, proof size, and all public inputs committed to the circuit. The lender sees no financial data whatsoever.

## Zero-Knowledge Proofs — In Plain Terms

A zero-knowledge proof lets one party (the prover) convince another (the verifier) that a statement is true without revealing *why* it is true or *what the underlying values are*.

### The Circuit

The underwriting circuit lives at [`circuits/lending/src/main.nr`](circuits/lending/src/main.nr). It is written in [Noir](https://noir-lang.org), a Rust-like ZK circuit language developed by Aztec.

**Private inputs** — the borrower's actual financial data. Known only to the borrower, mathematically hidden from the lender:

```
monthly_revenue              = [33_236_400, 34_441_800, 77_805_436, ...]   // 6 months, kobo
monthly_expenses             = [43_336_400, 45_121_800, 94_980_436, ...]
monthly_balances             = [83_666, 83_666, 83_666, ...]
revenue_volatility_bps       = 11_484    // 114.84%
customer_concentration_bps   = 5_600     // 56%
debt_ratio_bps               = 0
has_missed_repayments        = 0
account_age_months           = 5
```

**Public inputs** — the lender's thresholds. Committed into the proof. Visible to everyone:

```
required_monthly_revenue           = 80_000_000    // ₦800k
required_avg_balance               = 50_000        // ₦500
required_positive_cash_flow_months = 0
max_revenue_volatility_bps         = 12_000        // 120%
max_customer_concentration_bps     = 6_000         // 60%
max_debt_ratio_bps                 = 9_000         // 90%
require_no_missed_repayments       = 0
required_account_age_months        = 1
```

The circuit runs 8 constraint checks:

| # | Constraint |
|---|---|
| 1 | `avg(monthly_revenue) >= required_monthly_revenue` |
| 2 | `avg(monthly_balances) >= required_avg_balance` |
| 3 | `count(revenue > expenses) >= required_positive_cash_flow_months` |
| 4 | `revenue_volatility_bps <= max_revenue_volatility_bps` |
| 5 | `customer_concentration_bps <= max_customer_concentration_bps` |
| 6 | `debt_ratio_bps <= max_debt_ratio_bps` |
| 7 | `if require_no_missed_repayments: has_missed_repayments == 0` |
| 8 | `account_age_months >= required_account_age_months` |

If all constraints hold, Barretenberg generates a valid **UltraHonk proof** (~14 KB). If any constraint fails, no valid proof can be produced — it is mathematically impossible to fake a passing proof.

### The Proving Stack

| Step | Tool | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| Circuit language | Noir | Typed DSL for arithmetic constraint systems |
| Witness generation | `nargo execute` | Runs the circuit on real inputs, produces a witness |
| Verification key | `bb write_vk --scheme ultra_honk` | Derives the key used to verify proofs for this circuit |
| Proof generation | `bb prove --scheme ultra_honk` | Constructs the UltraHonk cryptographic proof |
| Cryptographic verification | `bb verify --scheme ultra_honk` | Verifies the proof off-chain (Soroban CPU budget cannot fit UltraHonk) |
| Policy publish | Soroban — `publish_policy()` | Lender commits underwriting criteria on-chain **before** any application is made |
| Loan config | Soroban — `set_loan_config()` | Lender stores XLM disbursement amount on-chain at publish time |
| On-chain decision + disbursement | Soroban — `record_decision()` | Re-checks proven thresholds against published policy; stores decision immutably; **atomically transfers XLM to borrower if APPROVED** |

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Install |
|---|---|---|
| Rust | 1.78+ | [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) |
| Node.js | 20+ | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| PostgreSQL | 14+ | via brew, apt, or Docker |
| Nargo | 1.0.0-beta.9 | `curl -L noirup.dev \| bash && noirup` |
| Barretenberg | matching | `curl -L bbup.dev \| bash && bbup` |

### 1. Clone and configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thewoodfish/guava.git
cd guava
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://guava:guava@localhost:5432/guava
JWT_SECRET=change-this-in-production
CIRCUITS_DIR=./circuits/lending
PORT=3001
RUST_LOG=guava_backend=debug
```

### 2. Create the database

```bash
# If PostgreSQL is running locally
createuser -s guava
createdb -O guava guava
# Or with docker
docker compose up -d postgres
```

### 3. Start the backend

The backend runs migrations automatically on startup.

```bash
# From repo root
cargo build
set -a && source .env && set +a
./target/debug/server
```

`▶ Guava backend listening on 0.0.0.0:3001`

### 4. Start the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

`▶ Next.js ready on http://localhost:3002`

### 5. Verify the circuit toolchain

```bash
cd circuits/lending
nargo test          # runs 3 built-in circuit unit tests
nargo check         # type-checks the circuit
```

## Demo Walkthrough

### As a Lender

1. Go to `http://localhost:3002` → **Become a lender**
2. Sign up with role **Lender**
3. On the **My Lending Profile** tab:
   - Enter a display name (e.g. *QuickFund Capital*)
   - Review the ZK criteria — kobo thresholds with live Naira hints
   - Set the **Loan Disbursement Amount** (stroops — e.g. `20000000` = 2 XLM)
   - Click **Save & Publish** — this calls `publish_policy()` and `set_loan_config()` on-chain; a "Lending Criteria Published on Stellar" card appears with the tx hash
4. Switch to the **Applications** tab and wait for borrowers

### As a Borrower

1. Open a new browser / incognito window → **Apply for a loan**
2. Sign up with role **Borrower**
3. On the **My Statement** tab:
   - Paste your Stellar testnet address into the **Stellar Wallet Address** field and click **Save** — this is where XLM will be sent if approved
   - Upload your XLSX bank statement
   - Click **Compute Metrics** — financial summary appears (not sent to any lender)
4. On the **Browse Lenders** tab:
   - See published lenders and their ZK criteria
   - Click **Apply** — a pending application is created
5. On the **Applications** tab:
   - Track status in real time; approved applications show a green "Loan Disbursed on Stellar" card

### Back as the Lender

1. Go to the **Applications** tab
2. See an anonymised applicant card — `Applicant #a284c02d` (no name, no financials)
3. Click **Generate Proof**
4. Watch the 4-step pipeline animate:
   - Compiling witness (`nargo execute`)
   - Writing verification key (`bb write_vk`)
   - Generating UltraHonk proof (`bb prove`)
   - Verifying proof (`bb verify`)
5. See the full result panel:
   - Verdict: `✓ LOAN APPROVED` or `✗ LOAN REJECTED`
   - Every predicate: PASS / FAIL
   - Proof hash, VK hash, proof size, circuit ID, all public inputs
   - **Stellar Decision Tx** — immutable on-chain record of the decision
   - **XLM Disbursed to Borrower** — tx hash + Stellar Expert link confirming funds sent

## Security Properties

**Cryptographic guarantees**
- A valid UltraHonk proof cannot be generated for inputs that do not satisfy all circuit constraints. The lender cannot be deceived by a forged proof — the math makes it impossible.
- Public inputs (lender thresholds) are committed into the proof. A proof cannot be reused for a different set of thresholds.
- The verification key is derived deterministically from the circuit. Swapping the circuit invalidates the key.

**Data minimisation**
- XLSX statements are parsed in memory; raw bytes are not persisted after transaction extraction.
- `Prover.toml` (the file containing private financial inputs) is written to disk only for the duration of `nargo execute` and deleted immediately after.
- Lenders receive only: proof bytes, verification key, public inputs (thresholds), and predicate verdicts. No raw financial figures.
- Borrower identity is anonymised in the lender view — displayed as `Applicant #<first-8-of-UUID>`.

**Authentication**
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt cost-12.
- JWTs expire after 7 days and are signed with HS256 using a server-side secret.
- All protected endpoints verify the token and extract the user's `id` and `role` before executing.

**Proof lock**
- A `Mutex` on `AppState` serialises concurrent proof generation requests. Barretenberg writes output to fixed paths inside the circuit directory; concurrent runs would corrupt each other's files.

### Known Limitations

> **This is a hackathon POC.** The core ZK proof pipeline and Soroban integration are real and working end-to-end. The data ingestion layer is intentionally simplified for the demo.

| Limitation | Why it matters | Production path |
|---|---|---|
| **Manual XLSX upload** | The biggest weakness of this MVP. A borrower uploads their own bank statement — which means the data is self-reported. A dishonest borrower could submit a doctored file. ZK proofs guarantee the *math* is correct, but they cannot guarantee the *input data* is authentic if that data comes from the user. | **Open Banking** (Mono, Okra, CBN Open Banking APIs) — the bank pushes the statement directly to Guava via a regulated API. The borrower authorises access; the bank transmits the data. No file ever touches the borrower's hands, so forgery is structurally impossible. |
| **UX friction** | Exporting an XLSX from a Nigerian bank app, locating the file, and uploading it is not a flow that scales to 40 million MSMEs. Most borrowers will drop off. | Open Banking eliminates this entirely — one tap to authorise, automatic data pull. |
| **Some metrics are pre-computed off-chain** | Revenue volatility, customer concentration, and debt ratio are computed by the Rust engine and passed as private witnesses. A dishonest prover could misrepresent them. | Compute inside the circuit, or attest from a trusted Open Banking oracle. |
| **Single concurrent proof** | The proof lock serialises all proof requests. | Dedicated proving cluster at scale. |
| **UltraHonk verification is off-chain** | Soroban's CPU instruction budget cannot fit a full UltraHonk verification for a 14 KB proof. `bb verify` runs off-chain; the Soroban contract records the result and re-checks the policy. | This is the correct architecture — identical to how production ZK rollups work (verify off-chain, settle on-chain). Not a limitation to fix. |

## Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1 — Hackathon POC (current)

**Data ingestion:** Manual XLSX upload — borrower exports their bank statement and uploads it. This is a deliberate simplification for the demo. It proves the ZK circuit, the proof pipeline, and the Soroban integration work end-to-end. It does not solve data authenticity at scale.

- XLSX bank statement upload and parsing
- 8-metric ZK circuit (Noir + Barretenberg UltraHonk)
- JWT auth with borrower and lender roles
- Lender policy configuration and publishing
- Borrower application flow with anonymised lender view
- On-chain loan decision recording via deployed Soroban smart contract on Stellar testnet

---

### Phase 2 — User Research & Validation

Before building further, we talk to real people.

- **Interview 20+ Nigerian SME owners** across Lagos, Aba, Kano, and Port Harcourt — traders, market vendors, logistics operators, tailors — to understand what the loan application process actually costs them in time and stress
- **Interview loan officers** at commercial banks, microfinance banks, and fintechs to understand what data they actually use in underwriting decisions vs. what they collect by default
- **Partner with at least 2 lenders** willing to pilot ZK-verified underwriting in a controlled setting
- **Define the minimum viable proof set** — which 3–4 metrics do lenders actually make decisions on?
- Publish findings openly

---

### Phase 3 — Open Banking Integration _(closes the forgery gap)_

The most critical engineering step after the POC. Manual XLSX upload is unforgeable in theory but self-reported in practice. Open Banking makes the data source trustworthy.

- Direct bank feed via **Mono**, **Okra**, or **CBN Open Banking APIs** — the bank pushes the statement directly; no file ever passes through the borrower's hands
- Borrower authorises with one tap; Guava receives a certified transaction feed
- Forgery becomes structurally impossible — data provenance is the bank, not the borrower
- Support for multi-bank accounts (common among Nigerian SMEs)
- Once the data source is trusted, the ZK proofs become fully trustworthy end-to-end

---

### Phase 4 — Lender Ecosystem

- Lender onboarding portal with policy templates
- Multi-lender proof reuse — one proof package, many applications
- Proof expiry and refresh logic
- Accounting connectors — QuickBooks, Sage, Zoho Books

---

### Phase 5 — POS & Revenue Data

- POS integrations — Moniepoint, Paystack, Flutterwave
- Prove revenue from POS data directly, without bank statements
- Real-time revenue proof for merchant cash advances

---

### Phase 6 — Expanded Proof Types

- Inventory and stock level proofs
- Tax compliance proofs (FIRS)
- Supplier relationship proofs

---

### Phase 7 — Universal Financial Identity

- One reusable, portable financial identity accepted by every lender on the network
- Cross-bank reputation — aggregated ZK proofs from multiple accounts and data sources
- Merchant controls exactly which metrics they share and with whom

---

## Why Stellar / Soroban

Stellar's sub-second finality and near-zero transaction fees make it practical to record proof verifications on-chain without the gas overhead of EVM chains. Soroban's Rust-native contract environment aligns directly with the backend stack.

### Deployed Contract

| | |
|---|---|
| **Contract ID** | `CBT2XJCW6BBK3U4GII5ESRQXJ3TPBPVE23F26VMSKHBP4O4S2VAVYKS5` |
| **Network** | Stellar testnet |
| **Explorer** | [stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/CCWTTKOP...](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/CBT2XJCW6BBK3U4GII5ESRQXJ3TPBPVE23F26VMSKHBP4O4S2VAVYKS5) |

### What the contract does

The contract has three load-bearing functions. **All three are called from the live backend.**

#### 1. `publish_policy` — lender commits underwriting criteria on-chain

When a lender publishes their profile, the backend invokes `publish_policy()`. This stores the lender's 8-field underwriting policy permanently on Stellar, keyed by lender ID. The policy is:

- **Public** — anyone can query it before any application is made
- **Immutable** — recorded at a specific ledger timestamp
- **Auditable** — the policy a borrower was judged against is verifiably the same one the lender committed to on-chain

#### 2. `set_loan_config` — lender stores XLM disbursement amount on-chain

Called alongside `publish_policy` when the lender saves their profile. Stores the per-loan XLM disbursement amount (in stroops) in Soroban persistent storage, keyed by lender ID. This means the disbursement amount is public and pre-committed — not chosen at decision time.

#### 3. `record_decision` — loan decision recorded and XLM disbursed atomically

After `bb verify` confirms the UltraHonk proof cryptographically (off-chain), the backend invokes `record_decision()`. The contract:

1. **Re-verifies the lending policy** — checks that the proven thresholds satisfy what the lender published. A proof generated under a laxer policy cannot be reused here.
2. **Records the decision immutably** — stores the proof hash, proven public inputs, lender address, decision (`APPROVED` / `REJECTED`), and ledger timestamp in Soroban persistent storage.
3. **If APPROVED: transfers XLM to the borrower atomically** — calls the native XLM SAC to transfer the pre-configured disbursement amount to the borrower's Stellar wallet in the same transaction. Proof passes → money moves. No separate disbursement step.
4. **Returns the Stellar transaction hash** — displayed in both the lender and borrower dashboards with a direct link to Stellar Expert.

The complete on-chain trail: **lender publishes criteria + loan amount → borrower applies → ZK proof generated → decision recorded + XLM sent in one atomic transaction.** Every step is anchored to Stellar. No financial documents change hands at any point.

## Why Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Lending

Traditional lending creates a privacy dilemma: the lender needs enough information to assess risk, but collecting that information exposes the borrower's most sensitive commercial data. The standard resolution — share everything, assess manually — does not scale and creates significant data liability for lenders.

ZK proofs dissolve the dilemma. The borrower computes a proof that their metrics satisfy a threshold. The lender verifies the proof. The mathematics guarantee that a valid proof could not have been produced without satisfying every condition — so the lender can trust the result without seeing the data that produced it.

For SMEs in emerging markets, where access to formal finance is already constrained, this changes the calculus entirely:

- A single proof can be shared with multiple lenders — no repeated disclosure
- Lenders can automate underwriting against verifiable signals — no document review
- The borrower's financial data is never shared with any lender — only the cryptographic proof is

**This is the infrastructure layer that privacy-preserving SME finance needs.**
