# Guava

## Privacy-Preserving Merchant Financing Using Zero-Knowledge Proofs

### Technical Specification (MVP)

Version 1.0

---

# Vision

Guava is a privacy-preserving underwriting protocol that enables businesses to prove financial health without revealing financial records.

Instead of uploading sensitive bank statements to every lender, merchants upload statements once, generate cryptographic proofs of selected financial metrics, and share only those proofs with lenders.

The lender learns only whether predefined lending requirements are satisfied.

Example:

Instead of revealing:

* Monthly Revenue = ₦6,482,313

The merchant proves:

> Monthly Revenue ≥ ₦5,000,000

without revealing the actual revenue.

Guava is infrastructure that sits between merchant financial records and lending platforms.

---

# Problem

SMEs seeking financing today must disclose:

* Complete bank statements
* Customer names
* Suppliers
* Transaction history
* Pricing
* Margins
* Cash reserves
* Internal operations

Most of this information is irrelevant to underwriting.

Banks only need answers to questions like:

* Is revenue above X?
* Is cash flow positive?
* Has the merchant repaid previous loans?
* Is the business financially stable?

Guava allows these questions to be answered using Zero-Knowledge Proofs instead of document sharing.

---

# Goals

### Merchant

* Keep financial data private
* Apply for loans faster
* Reuse proofs across lenders
* Eliminate repeated document submission

### Lender

* Faster underwriting
* Reduced fraud
* Automated loan approval
* Standardized financial verification

# System Components

## 1. Statement Ingestion

Purpose

Receive merchant bank statements.

Supported formats

* PDF
* Image (future)
* CSV (future)
* Open Banking API (future)

Input

```
January.pdf
February.pdf
March.pdf
```

Output

Raw document.

---

## 2. Statement Parser

Purpose

Convert every statement into a universal transaction format.

Different banks use different layouts.

Guava should normalize them into one schema.

Output

```json
{
  "date": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "credit": 25000,
  "debit": 0,
  "balance": 650000
}
```

The parser should extract:

* Date
* Description
* Debit
* Credit
* Balance

Parser Strategy

Phase 1

* OCR if necessary
* LLM-assisted extraction
* Validation rules

Future

Dedicated parsers per bank.

---

## 3. Transaction Classification

Purpose

Identify transaction types.

Categories

Revenue

Examples

* POS
* Card payment
* Transfer received

Expenses

Examples

* Supplier payment
* Utility bills
* Salary

Loan repayment

Examples

* Branch
* Carbon
* Moniepoint
* FairMoney

Transfers

Cash withdrawals

Taxes

Unknown

Classification can initially use an LLM before moving to deterministic rules.

### Zero-Knowledge

## Zero-Knowledge Layer

Guava uses **Noir** for circuit development and **Barretenberg's UltraHonk proving system** to generate efficient zero-knowledge proofs. The system is designed to produce succinct proofs for lending predicates (e.g., `monthly_revenue >= ₦5,000,000`) while keeping all underlying financial records private.

### ZK Stack

| Component             | Technology                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Circuit Language      | Noir                       |
| Proving Backend       | Barretenberg (UltraHonk)   |
| Proof Generation      | UltraHonk Prover           |
| On-chain Verification | Soroban UltraHonk Verifier |
| Smart Contracts       | Soroban (Rust)             |

### Soroban Integration

Guava will leverage existing UltraHonk verification implementations for Soroban:

* **UltraHonk Soroban Verifier**

  * `indextree/ultrahonk_soroban_contract`

* **Rust Integration**

  * `yugocabrio/rs-soroban-ultrahonk`

These repositories provide the verifier implementation required to validate Noir-generated UltraHonk proofs directly within Soroban smart contracts.

```

## Circuit Design

Each lending criterion is represented as a separate Noir circuit (or composed into a larger underwriting circuit).

Example predicates include:

* `monthly_revenue >= threshold`
* `cash_flow_positive == true`
* `average_balance >= threshold`
* `debt_ratio <= threshold`
* `revenue_volatility <= threshold`
* `no_missed_repayments == true`
* `customer_concentration <= threshold`

The circuits consume **private financial metrics** and expose only **public boolean assertions** or threshold commitments.

Example:

Private Inputs

```text
monthly_revenue = ₦6,482,313
average_balance = ₦1,120,000
```

Public Inputs

```text
required_revenue = ₦5,000,000
required_balance = ₦500,000
```

Public Outputs

```text
RevenueRequirement = TRUE
BalanceRequirement = TRUE
```

The lender learns only that the conditions are satisfied—not the underlying financial values.

---

## Proof Package

A generated proof package contains:

* UltraHonk proof
* Public inputs
* Circuit identifier
* Proof metadata
* Merchant identifier (or anonymous application ID)
* Timestamp

Raw bank statements, transactions, and computed financial metrics are **never included**.

---

## Soroban Verification

The lending contract receives:

* Proof
* Public inputs
* Circuit identifier

Using the UltraHonk verifier deployed on Soroban, the contract performs on-chain verification.

If verification succeeds, the contract proceeds with automated underwriting according to the lender's policy.

Example:

```text
Verify UltraHonk Proof
        │
        ▼
Valid?
        │
 ┌──────┴──────┐
 │             │
Yes           No
 │             │
Continue     Reject
```

---

## Design Principles

* Financial records remain entirely off-chain.
* Only cryptographic proofs and public verification inputs are submitted to Soroban.
* Proof generation occurs off-chain on trusted merchant infrastructure or Guava servers.
* Soroban is responsible only for proof verification and lending logic.
* The architecture is modular, allowing additional Noir circuits to be added as new underwriting metrics are introduced.

This approach keeps proof generation computationally efficient, minimizes on-chain costs, and leverages the existing Noir → Barretenberg → UltraHonk → Soroban ecosystem for end-to-end verifiable underwriting.


### Blockchain

Stellar

Responsibilities

* Store proof commitments or proof references
* Verify proof metadata (if applicable)

# Security

Never store plaintext financial records longer than necessary.

Encrypt uploaded statements.

Delete statements after proof generation (configurable retention).

Store only:

* Proofs
* Metric commitments
* Verification metadata
* Audit logs

No bank credentials should ever be collected.

Open Banking integrations.

Automatic statement sync.

---

### Phase 3

Accounting software integrations.

* QuickBooks
* Xero
* Sage

---

### Phase 4

POS integrations.

* Square
* Moniepoint POS
* Paystack
* Flutterwave

---

### Phase 5

Inventory verification.

Generate proofs for:

* Inventory turnover
* Stock levels
* Sales velocity

---

### Phase 6

Tax compliance proofs.

---

### Phase 7

Cross-bank reputation.

One reusable financial identity accepted by multiple lenders.

# Success Criteria (Hackathon MVP)

A successful demo should show the complete flow:

1. Merchant uploads 6 months of bank statements.
2. Guava extracts and normalizes transactions.
3. Financial metrics are computed automatically.
4. Zero-knowledge proofs are generated for selected lending criteria.
5. A Stellar-based lending application verifies those proofs.
6. The loan is automatically approved or declined without exposing any raw financial data.

---

# Long-Term Vision

Guava becomes the privacy layer for SME finance.

Instead of sharing financial documents, businesses share cryptographic proofs of financial health. Lenders receive trustworthy underwriting signals, merchants retain control of their data, and financial access becomes faster, more secure, and privacy-preserving.
